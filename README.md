# cassandra-fhir-index
Cassandra's Secondary Index implementation for FHIR® – Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (http://hl7.org/fhir/index.html). This implementation provides support for almost all the search operations defined in the FHIR search framework (http://hl7-fhir.github.io/search.html).  This index brings together two of the most potent products in the market Apache Cassandra and Apache Lucene. On one hand, Apache Cassandra provides high availability and scalability without affecting response times. On the other hand, Apache Lucene gives you full-featured text search engine.  The index makes possible to deploy an FHIR-compliant server with Cassandra as datastore. This significantly open the door to a new world of possibilities including analytics or real-time processing for health organizations.
